# Customer Churn Analysis - Post-Deployment Tasks

## Manual Steps Required

### 1. Folder Rename (Required)
Since the folder couldn't be renamed automatically due to process locks, please manually rename:
- From: `CustomerChurnFireProject` 
- To: `customer_churn_analysis`

**Steps:**
1. Close VS Code and any terminals
2. Navigate to: `c:\Users\ommou\OneDrive\Desktop\Custommer_churn_analysis\`
3. Right-click `CustomerChurnFireProject` â†’ Rename â†’ `customer_churn_analysis`
4. Reopen VS Code in the renamed folder

### 2. GitHub Repository Setup

After renaming the folder, create your GitHub repository:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd c:\Users\ommou\OneDrive\Desktop\Custommer_churn_analysis\customer_churn_analysis

# Run the GitHub setup helper
python setup_github.py
```

Or manually:
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `customer-churn-analysis`
3. Description: `Advanced ML pipeline for customer retention analytics`
4. Make it public
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

Then connect your local repo:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/customer-churn-analysis.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Deployment Options

**Option A: Quick Start**
```bash
python deploy.py
```

**Option B: Manual Start**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

**Option C: Development Mode**
```bash
python simple_check.py  # Check system
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py --server.port=8501
```

### 4. Project Structure (After Rename)
```
customer_churn_analysis/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ streamlit_app.py    # Main dashboard
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/              # Utility modules
â”œâ”€â”€ models/                 # Trained models
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                   # Dataset
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                   # Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ deploy.py              # Deployment script
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Project documentation
â””â”€â”€ setup_github.py       # GitHub setup helper
```

### 5. Verification Checklist

After completing the manual steps:

- [ ] System status shows all components active

### 6. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Run `python simple_check.py` to diagnose
2. Check `python status_check.py` for detailed status
3. Verify Python environment: `python --version`
4. Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 7. Next Steps

Once deployed successfully:
- Share the GitHub repository link
- Consider Docker containerization (Dockerfile provided)
- Add CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Expand the model with more features
- Add real-time data integration
